As the number of freshman students grow, so does the demand for on campus housing. Housing officials say they have a new option to solve this problem.\nDirector of Housing and Dining Services, Michael Mills, said,&#8221; This year, we&#8217;ve put in another option and that is formerly the Grove, that is now Mustang Village. We&#8217;re working on a partnership with them to where students can lease an apartment at Mustang Village still be through university housing, still have it added to their student account to where they can use their financial aid and other things. But, the idea is we would have Trigg available to our freshman students so that we were not asking as many freshmen to start off campus.&#8221;\nThe feedback on this new housing option is both positive and negative. Some students are excepting this new option because even though they will live off campus, they will still get the benefits of on campus housing.\n&#8220;We are going to operate as university housing, so we&#8217;re going to charge you one flat rate for the semester. That includes your bills, utilities, just like when you live on campus. There&#8217;s no other hidden fees associated. That&#8217;s just your semesterly rent. You will pay that directly to us. Through the business office instead of having to pay it over there. It is going to be for the students that what they could get on campus, the rate for Mustang Village is going to e $2,400 per semester. So for $2,400 you can get a spot in a three bedroom three bath apartment at Mustang Village,&#8221; Mills said\nAssistant Housing Director of the Trigg dorm, Heather Baker, says she&#8217;s heard nothing but god things from the students who currently live in Trigg.\n&#8220;They were actually really excited about the idea, I know some of the girls obviously their excited about the full closets, having less people to a bathroom and with Mustangs Village they&#8217;ll have their own bathroom, bigger bed, more space, they&#8217;re excited about it. The guys reactions were kind of more like, that&#8217;s what they were already planning on doing so they&#8217;re okay with it. They&#8217;re excited about it as well because I think it&#8217;s going to go on their own bills like university bills and they don&#8217;t have to worry about going out on their own and signing a contract,&#8221; Baker said\nThis option is now available to students when they go online and fill out request forms for fall housing.

Kyle Owen, associate vice president for facility services said those restrictions have forced the university to change some of its procedures.\nThe most obvious change is through irrigation or the lack of it, Owens said, adding that the campus is no longer using city water to irrigate any of the landscaping. The only irrigation the campus does is use well water for the athletic fields.\nWichita County officials said once the combined lake levels at Lake Arrowhead and Lake Kickapoo hit a combined 25 percent, the city of Wichita Falls would go into Stage 5 drought restrictions,\u00a0 restrictions that could pose a problem for MSU athletic fields.\nOwen said, even though the campus is using well water on the athletic fields, athletics doesn&#8217;t use as much as much water\u00a0 as it could if the university had unlimited funds. There\u2019s a safety aspect that\u2019s probably being sacrificed whether we like it or not, Owens said.\nWichita Falls Mayor Glenn Barham said the city is already looking into what a dire situation may look like based on data from previous years.\nWorst case scenario, and that\u2019s the summer of 2011 when we had 100 days of 100-degree temperatures, we have sufficient water to see us through mid-2016, Barham said.\nWell water is used to water the practice fields on campus, but the sand-based football field takes much more water to remain saturated than the softball or soccer fields. Owen said he\u2019s had to look into other options in the event that restrictions get tighter.\n&#8220;When we were deciding whether or not to try and spend the money for the well water harvesting for the football fields, I looked into the amount of water it would take to keep those alive if we trucked it in. It was like 9,000 gallons every 12 hours. That\u2019s assuming the city would sell it to us,&#8221; Owen said.\nBarham said the city is looking into several different ways to bring water to the area.\n\u201cThe city has gotten to the point to where we have to try everything that is feasible. We have to think outside the box and do things in hopes that it will provide us some relief,\u201d Barham said.\nThe director of public works for Wichita Falls, Russell Schreiber said the city is anticipating Stage 5 drought restrictions to take effect in the coming months.\n\u201cWe anticipate or project that to happen likely around the first of May under current climatic condition. If we get some rain this month that could get pushed back, but right now it looks like the first of May,\u201d Schreiber said.\nWith current drought conditions, city and university officials said they\u2019re willing to look into out of the box ideas to conserve water.\n\u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019ve kicked over every rock at this point, in this stage of the drought,\u201d Schreiber said.\nThe post Drought impacting MSU outdoor athletics appeared first on The Wichitan.\n","mediaID":"0","sourceID":"0","articleLink":""},{"articleID":"1559","lastChanged":"2014-04-02 21:49:00","title":"International students spread culture","link":"http:\/\/thewichitan.com\/international-students-spread-culture\/","comments":"http:\/\/thewichitan.com\/international-students-spread-culture\/#respond","pubDate":"Wed, 02 Apr 2014 14:11:32 +0000","docCreator":"miguel jaime","category1":"Campus","category2":"","shortDescription":"<p>International Fair from MWSU Campus Watch on Vimeo.

Photo by Ethan Metcalf.\nAn entire day of cultural programming began on March 29, with the International Fair hosted by the department of Student Development and Orientation. About 40 students attended the fair to see the culture booths and presentations, but the majority of attendees left after the free food samples like Mexican flan and Indian curry had been given out.\nAccording to Cammie Dean, director of student development and orientation, the lack of attendance at last Saturday&#8217;s International Fair may have been a good thing, though. She said her office was using the event as a test run for next year&#8217;s International Fair.\n&#8220;We weren&#8217;t really shooting to make it huge this year. Next year we&#8217;re going to really open it up, but we wanted to kind of get a feel for how much interest we would get,&#8221; Dean said.\u00a0&#8221;Next year we&#8217;ll look at planning further out and getting more people involved and getting the community aware because people love to bring kids to these things. It&#8217;ll be a good opportunity for that partnership with the community and invite them onto campus and celebrate with us.&#8221;\nDean said her department wants to expand the International Fair because 45 different countries are represented at the university, but Dean also said there just aren&#8217;t enough events for the students in spring.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s a combination of things, particularly that the bulk of students graduate in May. This is, for a lot of students, a last semester so there&#8217;s lots of that final capstone project thing going on,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;So there&#8217;s a somewhat greater time commitment academically, but it&#8217;s also a time when the student organizations who are really just kind of coming together in the fall are now seeing their things kicking in. We like to make room for that so that they can do their own thing.&#8221;\nDean said attendance was also hindered by holding the fair on Saturday instead of a school day, but she and other fair organizers will discuss moving the event to a weekday next year.\n&#8220;We&#8217;re probably open to discussion on that one. We don&#8217;t do a lot of weekend things on our campus. It kind of goes both ways. Because we don&#8217;t do a lot of weekend things people aren&#8217;t accustomed to come to weekend things,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;With every event that we do we&#8217;ll get feedback from the students who participated and we&#8217;ll pull the committee back together and talk about what worked well and what didn&#8217;t and what we want to change.&#8221;\nDean said the most successful event, as well as her favorite, was the cultural expo that kicked off the fair and featured culture booths, crafts and the ever-popular free food.\n&#8220;The expo itself is kind of that sight, sound and taste, even, of various cultures, and then some of the presentations that went on were very exciting.\u00a0There was some broad overviews and then there was some really specific interesting things,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;From China she showed how they take the Chinese characters and make words with them. So she showed like &#8216;man&#8217; and something else combined to make the word &#8216;crowd.&#8217; It was really fascinating.&#8221;\nAfter the expo, smaller sessions were held to display more specific aspects of the cultures on display. In Wichita 1 meeting room, music and dance from various cultures were shown as audience members recorded it all on their phones.\nMechanical engineering sophomores Pubuditha Jay, Janith Ambewela and Tharusha Wanigasekera performed Indian love songs for the audience.\n&#8220;It is a love song so it talks about how a couple gets to know each other and how they live their life. It has a good melody,&#8221; Wanigasekera said of the first song they played.\nThat song was a classic from the 1950s, Wanigasekera said, but they played a song written in 2009 next in order to display a wider range of Indian music, and they did it all with no rehearsing.\n&#8220;Actually, this was the rehearsal,&#8221; Ambewela said of the performance as the others laughed. &#8220;We were very busy the week before.&#8221;\nA parade of flags was scheduled for 3:30 p.m., but Dean said it was canceled because there weren&#8217;t enough participants. Instead, a slideshow featuring flags of all 45 countries represented at the university was displayed.\n&#8220;As of Wednesday we only had five countries signed up so I didn\u2019t think we could pull it off, so I kind of pulled back on that one because I didn\u2019t want to do it and not do it well,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;Next time we\u2019ll solicit separately for the flags cause we kind of solicited with the people who signed up.&#8221;\nDean said she wants to develop more events like the International Fair as part of something she calls &#8220;edu-tainment.&#8221;\n&#8220;We\u00a0don\u2019t want it to be too much like class, but we still want there to be a beneficial message. In this day and time, for your generation heading out into the work world which is more and more global, there really is a benefit to knowing others, understanding others from different backgrounds and from other countries because we\u2019re increasingly working across borders,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;So there\u2019s an advantage to that, professionally, but it doesn\u2019t all have to come from a textbook. It\u2019s the practical experience that\u2019s really nice.&#8221;\nThe post International Fair premieres to dwindling crowd appeared first on The Wichitan.\n",
